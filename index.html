<!-- 
<p>My research is centered around novel directions for <em>high-performance large-scale data management</em> systems. My research has a strong <em>theoretical</em> component (e.g., lower bound results, finite model theory, dependency theory) and a strong <em>algorithmic</em> component (e.g., external-memory algorithms, distributed algorithms, join algorithms). Currently, my focus is on the development of <em>scalable resilient systems</em> that can manage data and processing complex transactions, while providing strong guarantees toward users in the presence of faulty behavior (e.g., hardware failures, software failures, and malicious attacks).

<p>Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, Greater Noida, 
    India. I have done my Masters from <a href="https://www.akgec.ac.in">Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad</a> in Computer Science and Engineering. In my Master thesis project, I worked on <em>Cross Domain Sentiment Analysis Thesis Project</em> under the supervision of Lipika Goel and <a href=" https://www.akgec.ac.in/cse-faculty/ ">Sonam Gupta</a>. Finally, I did my Bachelor in computer science and engineering at the <a href="https://www.rggi.edu.in">Radha Govind Group of Institions, Meerut</a>, where I studied various subjects like <em>Data Structures, Database Management Systems, Automata, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Organization and Architecture, Digital Logic Design, Compiler Design, and more</em>.

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been a promising technology that offers extended solutions towards the development of agriculture. Various research institutions and scientific groups, as well as industries, are trying to cope with the challenges by delivering more and more IoT products for agricultural sector. In this paper, we aim to provide a survey of IoT systems, its enabling technologies, and communication technologies. Moreover, we provide insights into IoT enabled agricultural applications along with its architecture and research challenges. Finally, we discussed the security and privacy issues that occur in agriculture IoT along with some cybersecurity attacks.</p></blockquote></details></li></ol>

        <p>OBJECTIVES: To overcome the dependency of CDSC tasks on manual labeling of the dataset by proposing a polarity detection task. </p>
        <p>METHODS: We have proposed the CDSC-PDT method that is the polarity Detection Task (PDT) followed by the CDSC task. The proposed PDT task extracts the polarity of reviews from the source domain using the contextual and relevancy information of words in documents and this automatic labeled dataset is further used to train classifiers to make the further classification. </p>
        <p>RESULTS: Proposed method is comparable to the traditional learning method giving the highest precision 85.7%. 
        <p>CONCLUSION: The proposed method does not need to manually label the documents in either of the domain (source or target), hence it overcomes the human intervention and is also time saving and cheap process, unlike traditional CDSC tasks.</p>

    <p>Sentiment analysis is the field of NLP which analyzes the sentiments of text written by users on online sites in the form of reviews. These reviews may be either in the form of a word, sentence, document, or ratings. These reviews are used as datasets when applied to train a classifier. These datasets are applied in the annotated form with the positive, negative or neutral labels as an input to train the classifier. This trained classifier is used to test other reviews, either in the same or different domains to know like or dislike of the user for the related field. Various researches have been done in single and cross domain sentiment analysis. The new methods proposed are overcoming the previous ones but according to this survey, no methods best suit the proposed work. In this article, the authors review the methods and techniques that are given by various researchers in cross domain sentiment analysis and how those are compared with the pre-existing methods for the related work.</p>
